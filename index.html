                        In the waves of steam and machinery, who could achieve extraordinary? In the fogs of history and darkness, who was whispering? I woke up from the realm of mysteries and opened my eyes to the world.
                        Firearms, cannons, battleships, airships, and difference machines. Potions, divination, curses, hanged-man, and sealed artifacts‚Ä¶ The lights shone brightly, yet the secrets of the world were never far away. This was a legend of the ‚ÄúFool‚Äù

                        On that day, the fog blocked everything.

                        On that day, he became the captain of a ghost ship.

                        On that day, he stepped through the thick fog and confronted a completely subverted and fragmented world‚Äîthe old order had vanished, strange phenomonoms dominated the endless seas beyond civilized society, and isolated island city-states and fleets of ships challenged the sea that had become the last ember of lights for the civilized world. All of this while the shadows of the old days were still stirring in the deep sea, waiting to to devour this world that was about to die.

                        But for the new captain of the ghost ship Vanished, there was only one question he had to consider first: Who knows how to drive this ship?!
